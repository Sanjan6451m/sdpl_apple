                    With blazing performance and a high-quality, high-resolution display, Mac laptops immerse app designers in the ideal
                    environment for all-day creativity and productivity. Apps run simultaneously for a seamless workflow, and unified
                    memory allows them to share data between the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine efficiently. So everything you do is fast
                    and fluid. Large files can be quickly previewed from the desktop, allowing designers to flip through projects and
                    libraries in seconds. And with the brilliant display, images are incredibly detailed, text is razor-sharp, and
                    colors are rich and vibrant.

                    enrolled in your MDM solution and are ready out of the box. And because coding never stops, AppleCare for Enterprise
                    provides quick-response, expert support from the people who know Apple products best. Even your costs stay low,
